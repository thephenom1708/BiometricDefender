Paper Kit 2 is a free Bootstrap 4 UI Kit with pale colors, beautiful typography and thoughtful drawings. We created it having paper and drawings in mind.

Any elements that is vital to code a web project is already here, fully coded. All components are fully responsive and look great on every screen size. Transitions, shadows, colors, they all resemble the flow you would have using pieces of paper.

We have created the UI Kit kit having pastel colors and paper in mind. It feels light, fresh and easy to go through. It features beautiful typography, font icons and thoughtful layouts.

Paper Kit 2 has a PRO version with a huge number of components, sections and examples: Paper Kit 2 PRO (https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-kit-2-pro). Based on feedback from people that downloaded and used it, we have added needed components and we have created multiple examples pages. We are curious to see how you want to use it and also improve it, so let us know any feedback you have.

**Bootstrap 4 support**

Paper Kit 2 is built on top of Bootstrap 4 Beta, so it fully supports it. Most of the elements from the framework are re-designed to resemble sheets of paper and color pastels. If the are elements that we have not touched, they will gracefully fall back to the Bootstrap 4 default.

**Examples**

Paper Kit 2 contains some pages already designed and implemented. Here is the list with the pages available. We are also working on more example pages, that you will be able to access no matter the version you download.
